Version 5.7.0 (molinaro)
  * add annotation message support
  * add accessors for performance messages
  * fix for R15B port calls

Version 5.6.0 (molinaro)
  * add port count and limit to vmstats

Version 5.5.2 (molinaro)
  * syntax_tools needs to be in the required apps

Version 5.5.1 (molinaro)
  * performance trace deserialization was broken

Version 5.5.0 (molinaro)
  * vmstats can now be sent once a minute via mondemand when specified in the
    application config file.  A program id is required so a minimal config
    might be something like
      { vmstats, [ { program_id, mondemand } ] }
    in addition a context could be added via a context parameter with a
    2-tuple list as an argument like
      { vmstats, [ { program_id, mondemand }, {context, [{foo,bar}]} ] }

Version 5.4.2 (molinaro)
  * problem with context deserialization

Version 5.4.1 (molinaro)
  * missing file in 5.4.0 release, as well as some additions to the
performance tracing event.  Added contexts and a caller_label

Version 5.4.0 (molinaro)
  * support performance messages as well as allowing sending of different
  events to different channels.

Version 5.3.1 (molinaro)
  * typo in restart code meant hot-restarts were failing with bad_ip_port

Version 5.3.0 (molinaro)
  * allow more than one previous minute to be kept

Version 5.2.0 (molinaro)
  * allow host sent in events to be overriden by an application env variable
  and stored in a global (copied mochiglobal into the mondemand application).
  * added collect_time which is the time that statsets were collected.

Version 5.1.0 (molinaro)
  * added interface for gauges
  * cap counters to max signed int64 as that's what lwes is doing
  * allow for multiple configs in config file to emit to multiple servers
  * added an mondemand_stats module which centralizes operations around stats
  * added statset which collects samples in a reservoir and emits a
  configurable amount of statistics each emit interval

Version 5.0.0 (molinaro)
  * serialization of events now happens in calling process instead of while
  sending
  * make send_interval an application variable so you can change it from 60
  seconds if you want
  * mondemand:stats/0 now adds context when it's available
  * trace messages now always use dicts internally to better match other
  languages implementations

Version 4.1.1 (molinaro)
  * updated dependency on version of lwes

Version 4.1.0 (molinaro)
  * added a mondemand:stats/0 function to pretty-print stats
  * updated dependency on version of lwes

Version 4.0.0 (molinaro)
  * Trace messages now require a string message to be sent

Version 3.0.0 (molinaro)
  * Update to deal with new lwes-erlang
  * Added trace messages
  * removed send_event call from public API, use trace messages instead
  * sync version with other clients

Version 1.3.0 (molinaro)
  * Default types to counters when increment has been used, otherwise allow it
  to be set when sending stats
  * fix bug with context num

Version 1.2.0 (molinaro)
  * initial version, originally in another non-public repo, so versioning
    reflects an upgrade from that version
